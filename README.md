## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an interactive graphics application that encompasses several fundamental concepts and techniques. The key aspects covered in this project include:

1. **Architecture of an Interactive Graphics Application**: The project involves designing and implementing the architecture of an interactive graphics application, which allows users to interact with and manipulate objects in a graphical environment.

2. **Geometric Modeling using Primitive Instantiation**: The application explores the concept of geometric modeling by instantiating primitive objects such as cubes, spheres, and cylinders. These primitives serve as the building blocks for constructing more complex objects.

3. **Virtual Cameras**: The project incorporates virtual cameras to control the viewpoint and provide users with different perspectives of the scene. Users can switch between cameras to observe the scene from various angles and viewpoints.

4. **Orthogonal and Perspective Projections**: The application demonstrates the differences between orthogonal and perspective projections. It utilizes appropriate projection techniques based on the desired visual effects and requirements of the scene.

5. **Animation Techniques**: Basic animation techniques are implemented to bring objects to life. Users can animate objects by applying transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. These animations enhance the interactive experience of the application.

6. **Collision Detection**: The project incorporates simple collision detection techniques to detect and respond to collisions between objects. Collision detection algorithms are implemented to ensure realistic and accurate interactions between objects within the scene.
